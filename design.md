## What Does the Website Do?

Grobel is a way to organize links with context.

This information is tied to USERS.

USERS have associated DAY PAGES where POSTS are organized chronologically in a feed format.

POSTS are generated from saving a link with context, typically from a USERS screenshot. Each POST should have some associated image for context.

POSTS have two identifiers, a URL ID and a POST ID. This is so it is possible to retreive a history of context from a particular URL ID. There may be options for setting the specificity for URL ID (whether it's domain level or url level).

### USERS

USERS will default to a chronological page view, but will also have the ability to create more specific pages (based on tags or whatever).

### POSTS

Like Twitter, each POSTS will have the ability to COMMENT, RETWEET, LIKE, and SHARE.

## Routing

### Splash Page

- https://grobel.com  
  General splash page. Should have account creation and a blurb describing the product.

#### User Pages

- https://grobel.com/:user  
  Displays a user's chronological DAY PAGES with their associated POSTS in a feed format.
- https://grobel.com/:user/time/:timeId  
  Displays a specific DAY PAGE's POSTS.

#### Status Pages

Trying to emulate Twitter routing.

- https://grobel.com/:user/status/:urlId/:postId  
  Returns a POST.
- https://grobel.com/:user/status/:urlId/:postId/photo/1  
  Returns the image associated with a post. Additional photos will be routed by incrementing the last value.
- https://grobel.com/:user/status/:urlId/history  
  Returns the history for a particular url.

The USER PAGE is subdivided into DAY PAGES if there is content there.
